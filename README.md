# FIFA-Fever

## Description
The project objective is to pull different relevant information that is available from different websites into one webpage. Instead of visiting multiple websites, as a football (soccer - the REAL football) fan, the website will be a one-stop page for all the users information needs (pulling on data from two different websites/APIs). The website displays the standings of the user's favorite team, and provide information on players of the team, and displays video clips of games played.
There were a couple of challenges with fetching data from the API but we found a way around it as a team. Using foundation framework for the first time was also a little challenging. We learnt how to replace error images pulled from API with a placeholder.

## Usage
The user clicks on the website url and is presented with an input box to search for favorite teams. Once the user types in their preferred team, the submit button is clicked and the information is displayed. The standing of the team in the current World cup is displayed with the team flag. The images of the players of the team are also shown alongside their player type. Underneath the submit button is a list of previously searched teams displayed in-line because the search results are saved in the local storage. The videos of the games and highlights of matches are also displayed on the screen.
